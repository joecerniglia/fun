    "### Asteroids with Orbital Animations\n",
    "Each day asteroids are orbiting the sun. As of October 27, 2022, NASA has identified and is tracking 1.1 million asteroids. Many more remain undiscovered and untracked. Some of these come within a few hundred thousand miles of earth as they orbit. Here you can take a look at a random selection of space hazards NASA is tracking each day. Hazardous objects are those of a certain size which are calculated to approach within .05 AU of the earth. The AU is the astronomical unit. 1 AU = the distance between the earth and the sun. .05 AU is 1/20th the distance between Earth and the Sun. 93 million * .05 = 4,650,000 miles. In terms of the distances of space, this is close.\n",
